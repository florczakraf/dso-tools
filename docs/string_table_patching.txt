When changing the contents of global string table you might find yourself in
need for changing the related offsets in code and string references. Simple
maintaining of the total length is not enough.

VM opcodes that consume offsets are:
 - OP_TAG_TO_STR (0x45)
 - OP_LOADIMMED_STR (0x46)
 - OP_DOCBLOCK_STR (0x47)
 - OP_ASSERT (0x54)

Where "consume" means that the following code instruction is an offset in bytes
from the beginning of the string table in the raw form. Offsets in reference
table work the same way.
